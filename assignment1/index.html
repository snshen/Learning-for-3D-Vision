<p>Tradeoffs between rendering as a mesh vs a point cloud:</p>
<p>The point cloud is generated by sampling a parametric function while the mesh is generated by using voxelized coordinates to query an implicit function. </p>
<p>When comparing these methods, the point clouds render faster than the meshes when generating an equal number of points and voxels. This difference is due to the fact that the mesh needs to voxelize the 3D space before sampling the implicit function and apply the marching cube algorithm after sampling to extract the closest 0-level set voxel values whereas the point cloud directly uses the sampled outputs from the parametric function. </p>
<p>The comparitive quality between the two representations depends on application. Individual points in a point cloud are more accurate than the mesh vertices as the voxelized output is unlikely to match the 0-level of the implicit function exactly, although this accuracy can be improved with higher resolution voxelization. However, point cloud representations do not imply surfaces and are thus difficult to texture and shade like a mesh. Additionally, meshs make assumptions about the surface of an object in between calculated vertices, which can be good for visualization and reducing noise but bad for accurately representating details on objects.</p>
<p>The ease of use of these representation is again dependant on application. Point clouds can be easier to compute with certain processes such as rotating or modifying the object as the computational costs for changing a set of cartesian point is less that recalculating the voxelized mesh vertices and their associated faces. However, for other processes that involve spatial awareness between points, processing unstructured point clouds can be inefficient without additionally utilizing associatied indexing or octree methods. Also, meshes provide continuous surfaces that allows for easier normal estimations compared to point clouds.</p>
