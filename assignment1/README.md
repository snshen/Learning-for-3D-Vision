# Instructions for Running Homework

All deliverables turned in for the homework can be generated by running the following command from the current directory:

```
python main.py
```

please ensure that you do not remove or modify the subdirectory titeled "submissions" as this is where all graphics will be saved.

Note, main.py imports functions from helper.py for sections 5 and 7 and utilizes starter files as directed by the assignment description.

WARNING: This code is written to run on cpu. While I have tried to maintain "device" functionality, the code is untested on GPU. On CPU the script should take around 1.5 hours to run (much of the time is spent on point cloud rendering in section 5).
